# Decisions

Judgement calls made while building, with the reason for each. Eric asked to be involved as little as possible, so
these weren't reviewed first. Most are a single line in `packages/core/src/settings.ts`.

## Milestone 1: match engine and scoring

- **Engine build: Stockfish 19 "lite single-threaded" WebAssembly** (npm `stockfish`, 1.8 MB). It's the small-network
  build the spec asks for, needs no cross-origin isolation headers, and the same file runs in Node (child process)
  and the browser (Web Worker). It speaks plain UCI over text. At 100,000 nodes a search takes about 0.15 s in Node
  here, and repeated searches give identical numbers.
- **One search scores a whole group.** A MultiPV search returns the top N moves with win/draw/loss for each; any
  picked move outside them gets one extra search restricted to those moves (`searchmoves`). Bots use the same top-8
  search. Every search starts with `ucinewgame`, which clears the hash.
- **Expected score** = (win + draw / 2) / 1000 from Stockfish's WDL output, from the mover's side.
- **A board's expected score for retirement** is taken from the previous round's search (the drawn move's score,
  flipped to the new side to move), so no extra search is needed before dealing.
- **Grouping:** a local search that swaps players between groups, treating "same board as last round" as a hard
  constraint (while 4+ boards) and repeat groupmates as a soft cost. In tests it reaches zero repeats.
- **Openings: Lichess chess-openings (CC0).** For each named variation, take its longest line. Short lines are
  extended with the engine's best moves to 21 plies, and each is scored at 20 and 21 plies, so any board can start
  with either side to move (a replacement board must match the others). A line is kept if either ending is inside
  0.40–0.60. "Unusual" means irregular openings: the Lichess A00/B00 families plus a short list of offbeat
  gambits (`UNUSUAL_FAMILIES` in the build script).
- **Each match picks 7 classic + 1 unusual opening from different families.**
- **Chess rules: chess.js** (BSD-2). The board UI component is chosen in milestone 3.
