# Ops: hosting, deploy, capacity and limits

Lane: `ops`. Step-by-step setup is in `DEPLOY.md`.

## How it works today

- **Hosting:** Cloudflare, on Eric's account (Workers Paid, $5/month, which Containers need): one Worker
  (`chessroyale`) serves the built app and routes `/api/*` and `/admin/fairplay`; Durable Objects for each lobby
  (`Lobby`), the matchmaker (`Matchmaker`) and the live hub (`LiveHub`); the engine server as a Container
  (`EngineServer`, `standard-2`, `max_instances` 2); D1 (`hunchess`) for accounts, results, the locker, fair play and
  budgets. The domain is hunchess.com.
- **Deploy:** every push to `main` builds (`npm run build`) and deploys (`npx wrangler deploy`) through Workers Builds.
  The "Workers Builds: chessroyale" check fails instantly on PR branches (Cloudflare's preview build for non-production
  branches): only `check` (typecheck and unit tests, `.github/workflows/check.yml`) and the e2e run decide whether a PR
  is green. Merge with a merge commit, then confirm the deploy live.
- **Schema at runtime:** D1 tables are made by the Worker (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, then `ALTER TABLE` migrations
  that tolerate re-runs), so a deploy needs no migration step.
- **Built for surges** (measured with simulated players on staging):
  - **The matchmaker:** PLAY presses are tickets in memory, seated in batches (one seat reservation per lobby per
    batch), admitted at `CAPACITY.queue` rates; past `CAPACITY.overload` the answer is "Servers are busy, you're in
    line: about N s" with a ticket, never a blank screen or a lost match.
  - **The live line:** the live hub keeps who's online and which lobbies run in memory; Worker instances pass on who
    they've seen in batches (`presence.ts`, at most every `CAPACITY.presence.flushMs`), lobbies report changes at most
    every 2 s, each Worker caches `/api/live` for 3 s, and D1 gets `users.last_seen` once a minute per account.
  - **Rate limits:** per address, per account and (PLAY, new lobbies) per account again (`CAPACITY.rateLimits`,
    `limits.ts`), counted in each Worker instance's memory; past a limit, a friendly 429 with when to try again.
- **Costs and guards:** engine server re-checks capped by `ENGINE_DAILY_SEARCHES` (3000 a day, D1 `engine_usage`);
  fair play's deep re-checks by `FAIRPLAY.deep.dailySearches` (D1 `fairplay_budget`) on their own instance; the
  deep re-check's cron runs every 15 minutes (`triggers.crons`). Suggested budget alert: $20/month.
- **Load-test counters** at `/api/ops/stats` only where `OPS_STATS` is set and the request's `x-ops-key` matches
  (local and staging, never production).

## Where the code is

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Worker routes, scheduled jobs | `packages/server/src/index.ts`, `api.ts` |
| Bindings, containers, crons, staging env | `wrangler.jsonc` (repo root) |
| The matchmaker's plumbing (not its matching rules: `ranked`'s) | `packages/server/src/matchmaker.ts`, `queue.ts` |
| Live counts and presence | `packages/server/src/live-hub.ts`, `live.ts`, `presence.ts` |
| Rate limits | `packages/server/src/limits.ts` |
| Load-test counters | `packages/server/src/ops.ts` |
| Load tests (simulated players over WebSockets and the API) | `scripts/load/` (`run.ts`, `burst.ts`, `staging.sh`) → `reports/load/` |
| The engine server | `engine/`, `packages/server/src/engine.ts` |
| CI | `.github/workflows/check.yml` |

## Settings

`CAPACITY` (queue, overload, presence, rate limits), `LOBBY_LIFE` in settings.ts; Worker variables
`MATCH_FILL_SECONDS`, `ENGINE_DAILY_SEARCHES`, `ENGINE_OFF`, `OPS_STATS`, `LOAD_TEST` (staging only).

## Tests and tools

- Unit: `packages/server/test/capacity.test.ts`, `matchmaker.test.ts`, `live.test.ts`, `lobby-life.test.ts`.
- e2e: `e2e/busy.spec.ts` (servers busy), `lobby-close.spec.ts`.
- Load: see `DEPLOY.md`, "Load testing". Run wrangler from a copy you aren't editing (it reloads on every change).

## Rules for this area

- Money is Eric's: never raise instance counts, caps or plans, or add a paid service, without asking him with a
  monthly estimate. The actual purchase or sign-up is his.
- Never load-test production: use the staging copy and tear it down after.
- Measure, fix, measure again: every scaling change comes with before/after numbers in `reports/` and DECISIONS.
- Degrade, don't die: under overload, a clear "busy, you're in line", never a blank screen or a lost match.
- Anything the server starts has an end, with a test for each way it ends (`.claude/LESSONS.md`).
